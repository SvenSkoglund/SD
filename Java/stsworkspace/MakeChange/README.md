## Make Change Project

### Skill Distillery Week 1 Homework

Program to calculate change

## Project Instructions 

In the cash register we will calculate the amount of change returned to a customer based on the purchase price and the amount tendered. We will also notify the attendant how many of each piece of currency ($20 ,$10 ,$5 ,$1, .25c, .10c, .05c, .01c) is needed to make the change for the customer. Change should be provided using the largest bill and coin denominations as possible. Denominations that are not used should not be displayed.

## Conclusion

In this project we used several concepts learned during week 1, including methods, arrays, loops, different data types, and casting. We use integer division and modulus operators to calculate the amounts of each bill needed and the change left over after calculating each bill. Finally, we display the information in an easy to read format.

### Black Jack Project

## Description
Use classes to create a functional command line blackjack game. Implement implement methods and fields to store data you think you would need during a blackjack game.

## Concepts Applied

* Classes and Object Oriented Design 
* Building classes whose fields are Objects.
* Methods
* Collection Types
* Conditionals and Logic

## Stretch Goals Applied

I added functionality to allow the player to make bets. The player starts with a wallet of $100, and is asked to make a 5 dollar minimum bet each round. If the player runs out of money, the game ends. If the player enters a wager that is larger than the balance in their wallet.

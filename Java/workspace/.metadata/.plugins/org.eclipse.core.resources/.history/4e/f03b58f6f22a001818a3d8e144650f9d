### Black Jack Project

## Description
Use classes to create a functional command line blackjack game. Implement implement methods and fields to store data you think you would need during a blackjack game.

## Concepts Applied

* Classes and Object Oriented Design 
* Building classes whose fields are Objects.
* Methods
* Collection Types
* Conditionals and Logic

## Stretch Goals Applied

I added functionality to allow the player to make bets. The player starts with a wallet of $100, and is asked to make a 5 dollar minimum bet each round. If the player runs out of money, the game ends. If the player enters a wager that is larger than the balance in their wallet.

## Known Issues

One issue I have had was in the displaying of cards in a players hand. Specifically, when an "Ace" is displayed, it shows the value "11" rather than the word "Ace". This leads to the text reading as "11 of Hearts, 11 of Spades, etc."
